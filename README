#==Introduction
# GoogleDocs is a full featured wrapper for version 3.0 of the Google Documents API (aka DocList).  GoogleDocs provides the ability
# to create, update and delete google documents, metadata and content.  The gem also includes support for folders, modifying
# permissions for documents via ACL feeds, and much more.
#
#
# GoogleDocs is based on the GoogleDocs Gem see http://cookingandcoding.com/google_docs
# GoogleDocs uses the GData4Ruby Gem for interacting with the Google API.  Check out http://cookingandcoding.com/gdata4ruby for

# ==Description
# GoogleDocs includes the following classes: Service, Folder, BaseObject, Document.
# 
# The Service object provides functionality for authenticating with the Google Documents API, grabbing a list of 
# documents and a list of folders associated with the account.
# 
# Interacting with objects is done by using the associated subclass of BaseObject, i.e. Document.  Every object
# class supports the same inherited methods for creating, updating and deleting, in addition to changing
# ACL permissions, and adding and removing from various folders.
